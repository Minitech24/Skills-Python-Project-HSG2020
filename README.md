For our final project in the course "Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages " our group creates an automated data analytics programm with which a user can interact with.  
The program is written in python and features the main tools for data pre-processing and visualization.  
The program should be executed in a Python IDE so the user can interact with it via the respective IDE's console.  
The only requirement is the uploaded file having to be in csv format.
