Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages 
Spring 2020

For our final project in the course "Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages " my group and I create an automated data analytics programm with which a user can interact with. 
The program is written in python and features the main tools for data pre-processing and visualization. 
The program should be executed in a Python IDE so the user can interact with it via the respective IDE's console. 
The only requirement is the uploaded file having to be in csv format.
