For my final project in the course "Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages " I created an automated data analytics programm with which a user can interact with.  
The program is written in python and features the main tools for data pre-processing and visualization. The program is best executed in Jupyter Notebook. The only requirement is the uploaded file having to be in csv format.  

I have uploaded three csv files with respective manuals with which any user can easily test the program.
I highly recommend the Starcraft2 and Singapore Airbnb files, as these are the most interesting.
